## Mathematics Today: Enigmaths 203

This is meant to help create combinations and lists to aid the solving of Enigmaths Puzzle 203: Magic of Xmas by ZAG.

# Problem description:

This is a Magic Square Puzzle, in that there are three concentric squares; the outer 7x7, the middle 5x5, and the central 3x3 are each magic squares, between them using the numbers 1 to 49 to fill the cells.

Cells are clued as follows:
- C = cube
- S = square
- P = prime
- T = triangular
Any friendly cell (the entry is divisble by the sun of its digits)that falls outside of these categories is labelled F. Only one column includes adjacent primes in its cells. 

|F|S| |T|T|P|P|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P|F|P| |P| |P|
|C| |F|P| |S|F|
|S|P|P|S|C| |P|
| |F|T|T| | |T|
|P|ST|P|T|P|F|PT|
